<h3>Step 5: Make Alonzo move more often when he's not clicked</h3>
<p>
The idea for this step is to have the delay that controls when the unclicked sprite moves to a different position get smaller every time he's clicked (to make the game more challenging). The delay will start at 2 and drop by 0.1 second with every click.
</p>
<p>
You should make a new variable called <tt>DELAY</tt> (to keep consistent with 
our solution).
