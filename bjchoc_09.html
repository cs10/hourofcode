<li>The <img src="images/LookSelected.png" width="20%"> tab contains blocks that control visual properties of Alonzo's sprite.  You could change it (make it fade out, change its size, say something) depending on things (whether Alonzo is clicked, moves by itself, the high score is surpassed, etc.).</li>
